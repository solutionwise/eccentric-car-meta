#AI Model Architecture & Intent Processing

Query Understanding Pipeline
User Query → Intent Analysis → Query Enhancement → Embedding
Generation → Vector Search
"red luxury car" → {color: red, type: luxury, vehicle: car} → "red
luxury sedan BMW Audi" → [0.2, -0.1, ...] → Results

1. Intent Analysis Service
Purpose: Break down natural language queries into structured automotive concepts
Model: GPT-3.5-turbo
Process:
// Example input/output
input: "show me a fast red car"
output: {
"color": ["red"],
"performance": ["fast", "sporty", "high-performance"],
"vehicle_type": ["car", "sports car", "coupe"],
"confidence": 0.85,
"enhanced_query": "red sports car fast performance coupe"
}

2. Query Enhancement
Purpose: Expand user queries with automotive synonyms and related terms
class QueryEnhancer {
constructor() {
this.automotiveTerms = {
"fast": ["sporty", "performance", "turbo", "racing"],
"luxury": ["premium", "high-end", "executive", "leather"],
"family": ["spacious", "practical", "SUV", "minivan"],
"cheap": ["budget", "affordable", "economy", "compact"]
};
}
}

Success Criteria
• Successfully upload and tag 100 automotive images
• Search returns relevant results in under 2 seconds
• Natural language queries work (e.g., “luxury red car”)
• Basic admin interface functional
• System handles 10 concurrent users without errors

Limitations & Future Enhancements
• No user authentication (single user system)
• Local file storage only
• No image-to-image search
• No advanced filtering
• No deployment considerations
• Limited to 100 images
This MVP provides a solid foundation that can be extended with enterprise features, user
management, cloud deployment, and more sophisticated AI capabilities.
